the first option the tool allows you to adjust is the number of random words to be generated. you can choose as many or as few as you'd like. 
you also have the option of choosing words that only begin with a certain letter, only end with a certain letter or only begin and end with certain letters.\
 if you leave these blank, the randomized words that appear will be from the complete list.
